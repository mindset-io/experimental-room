Humans being are used to forget a lot of important things during its life. Forgetting that we are going to die is one simple and obvious example.

Remembering this kind of things, despite fearing is a good way to improve our lives, or better, to improve the way we face our lives.

We are in constant change and this is one thing we use to forget, or to not even notice. We really believe we are going to be same for all our life. That decisions we make now are going to stand for the rest of our lives.

Sometimes we even think we need to make a big change that is going to solve all the problems we have.
